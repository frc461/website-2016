<h2>Community Activities</h2>
<h3>Team to Team interactions</h3>
 <p>WBI 461 has also helped mentor six separate teams: 1555, 1646, 1747, 2171, 3487, and 4272 and brought the FIRST program to schools and people who had never before experienced it. We originally included all of the schools in our region, but then our team got too large, and we had to split into multiple different teams. For the 2005 season we split into 1646; the next year we split again creating team 1747. In 2012 we helped form 4272.

<h3>Indiana State Fair Presentation</h3>
<p> The team has been a part of the state fair for the past eight years. This participation has been a great opportunity for our team to demonstrate the joys of science, math, technology and engineering. We have presented programs and set up FLL, Vex, and FRC robots for attendees to drive.
