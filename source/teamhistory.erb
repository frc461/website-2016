		<p>In our sixteenth season we went through numerous iterations of robot design, improving our lift with each one. Through all the changes and challenges Rowdy 16 was debuted. We made it all the way to third place at the Indianapolis District, where we were honored to win the Engineering Inspiration for our work with the Boy Scouts of America. We were also honored to win the Judges Award at State.</p>

		<p>2005 was WBI's sixth season. The team grew even more this year, and the focus was on having a great robot and expanding out into the community. WBI served as a mentor team this year to Teams 1555 at North White High School, Team Pulse, and 1646 at Lafayette Jefferson High School, Team Boiler Precision Guessworks. Our partnerships involved sending students and advisors to work with the teams at their schools as well as promoting the <em>FIRST&reg</em> experience. During 2005, WBI also assisted with the operation and setup of the Boilermaker Regional in West Lafayette, Indiana, as well as competing in it. At the Boilermaker Regional, WBI received the Website Design award. WBI also competed in the Motorola Midwest Regional, where the team won the Team Spirit Award for BOSS (Boiler Online Scouting System), an online database of scouting information on all of the teams at the regional. (Scouting data can be downloaded for the Boilermaker Regional, the Motorola Midwest Regional, and the Championship Event in Curie division can be found at http://www.thebluealliance.com/team/461/2005.) WBI also attended the Championship Event in Atlanta, Georgia.</p>

WBI was awarded the Leadership in Control Award in honor of our programming efforts. At the Motorola Midwest Regional in Evanston, Illinois, we won the award for Website Design. We were also chosen as the first pick of sixth seed CFHS Robotics (#525) in elimination rounds. At the National Competition, the WBI alliance was 2nd overall in the Curie division, and 5th in the nation. At the 2004 Indiana Robotics Invitational, WBI won the Animation Award for a fantastic animation made within only a day.</p>

By this time, the team had established itself in <em>FIRST&reg</em> and was ready to take on another season. In 2002, the team attended 3 regionals: Buckeye Regional in Cleveland, Motorola Midwest Regional in Chicago, and the St. Louis Regional, in St. Louis. WBI placed 6th place overall at the Motorola Midwest Regional and 5th place overall at the St. Louis Regional, making it the first year that WBI made it to the final rounds.

		<p>In 2001, new students were brought on the team, raised the numbers to 22 high school students from West Lafayette, Harrison, and Jefferson high schools, 18 Purdue students, 2 high school teachers, and 3 industry professionals. More of the new advisors had been on teams in high school themselves, and the diversity and experience brought to WBI became a huge asset to the team. Funding improved and the team was able to attend the Motorola Midwest Regional and the National Championship. The team also went to several post-national competitions, the Indiana Robotics Invitational (IRI) and the Ford Sweet Repeat (FSR). The team took home the Daimler Chrysler Spirit Award from the Motorola Regional and the Teamwork Award from the IRI. The season was capped off by winning both the entire tournament and the Girls Championship at the Ford Sweet Repeat (FSR).</p>

	<div class="panel-body">
		<img class="pull-right history" src="/images/original-teampic_00.png" />
		<p>In January of 2000, the team, Westside Boiler Invasion 461 (WBI 461), tackled the challenge of designing a robot. The robot was named Rowdy Pete 1, reflecting Purdue's great influence on WBI 461. In the first year, Westside Boiler Invasion was comprised of 18 high school students from West Lafayette and Harrison High Schools and 12 Purdue University students. The team was unique in the fact that it was completely student run. The team competed in the Motorola Midwest Regional, taking home the Rookie All-Star award. But the memories and hard work didn't stop there. At that time, the team did not have enough funds to buy uniforms (the team tie-dyed their own shirts, earning the nickname "Team Sherbet"), let alone attend the National Championship, which is the culminating event of the season. The advisors knew the great benefit of competing at nationals and did not want to let this opportunity pass by. Thus, everything possible was done to raise money: begging companies, getting donations from alumni, and even getting another team (Truck Town Terror #68, now called Truck Town Thunder) to pay for the hotel. The gracious professionalism paid to WBI 461 was immeasurable. All the effort put forth by the team paid off when Westside Boiler Invasion qualified for nationals at Motorola. Our team also set its precedent of being extremely spirited. Even though no awards were won at nationals, the fact that the team got there was enough to make it among the best experiences of everyone on the team.</p>
