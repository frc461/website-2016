	<h3>What is Westside Boiler Invasion</h3>
	<p>Westside Boiler Invasion (WBI) is a high school robotics team located in West Lafayette, IN, that competes in the FIRST (For Inspiration and Recognition of Science and Technology) Robotics Competition. More importantly, though, Westside Boiler Invasion 461 is an amazing program that inspires students to do more with their lives. Through hands on work on robots, animations, websites, and other projects, team members learn the promise of science and technology.</p>
<h3>Mission</h3>
	<p>To inspire high school students to excel in the fields of technology and engineering, realizing their untapped potential.</p>
<h3>Vision</h3>
	<p>To develop into an influential force in order to spread the message of FIRST beyond the boundaries of our high school and community.</p>
<h3>Changing Lives</h3>
	<p>FIRST and Westside Boiler Invasion teach important technical knowledge, skills in management, and public relations to its members and community. Team involvement also strengthens students' life skills, particularly their organization, dedication, and capacity for hard work.</p>
<p>The FIRST and WBI programs attract the interest of students in the fields of science and technology. These organizations affect everyone involved, including teachers, advisors, sponsors, and the community. While involvement in FIRST requires a lot of work, the work pays back tenfold.
</p>
<p>Each January, FIRST announces the rules for the year's game. The high school team members work with engineers, teachers, and college advisors to design and construct a robot to play the game. Constructing the robot is a difficult task--each team gets merely six weeks to complete it, after which teams compete in regional and national competitions. Although the competition and the building of the robot take only a few months, Westside Boiler Invasion works throughout the entire year.</p>

<h3>ABOUT FIRST</h3>
<p>
FIRST, or, "For Inspiration and Recognition of Science and Technology," was founded in 1989 by Dean Kamen to inspire young people's interest and participation in science and technology. Their mission, according to the FIRST website, is to "inspire young people to be science and technology leaders, by engaging them in exciting mentor-based programs that build science, engineering and technology skills, that inspire innovation, and that foster well-rounded life capabilities including self-confidence, communication, and leadership."
In 2013, the FIRST Robotics Competition currently encompasses more than 50,000 high-school students on over 2,500 teams. The majority of high-school students engage in the FRC, or FIRST Robotics Competition. During build season, students have a six week time period to design, build, and debug their robot to meet specifications and rules set for the competition that year.
