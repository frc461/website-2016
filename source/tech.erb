<h2>Competitions and Robots </h2>
 <p>Every year, robotics teams from around the nation build robots to play a predetermined game using a standard "kit of parts" and some elbow grease. The game every year focuses on promoting helpful and innovative ideas that could be applied to life. Here is a compilation of each years game and corresponding robots.
<h3>Stack Attack</h3>
 <p>The object of this game  is for each robot to stack the most number of plastic storage containers on its own side of the field. There is a ten second human player round. During this time, the human player can place eight containers in its own alliance's zone.
 </p>
 <p>During the fifteen second autonomous period, the robots compete without human control and they try to place the containers in their own scoring zone. By multiplying the number of containers in the highest stack by the number of total containers in the scoring zone, the final score is determined. An additional twenty-five points is awarded to each robot that is on the top of the platform at the end of the match.
 </p>
 <p>The WBI robot used in this year's game was Rowdy IV.
 </p>
<h3>Raising the Bar</h3>
 <p>The game starts out with a fifteen second autonomous period. During this time, both teams' robots will try and go to the Ball Tees, remove the balls and trigger the Ball Release device at the end of their field. After the auto period, the robots will collect balls and give them to the human players. The human players will then throw the balls out into the goal so that the robots can score points.
 </p>
 <p>At the end of the game, the final score is the sum of points that the balls scored in the goals. The points are doubled if the goals are capped and an additional fifty points is awarded to any robot that is hanging from the bar in the middle of the field.

 <p>The WBI robot used in this year's game was Rowdy V.

<h3>Triple Play</h3>
 <p>The 2005 game involved two alliances of three robots each. The field has 9 tetrahedron goals; placed in a three by three formation. . The scoring objects in this year's game are tetrahedrons that you can stack on top of the tetrahedron goals to gain 3 points (multiple tetras can be stacked on top of the goal for 3 points each), or place under those same goals for 1 point.
 </p>
 <p>In autonomous mode, a robot can grab special randomly placed vision tetras and place them on top of a goal, in the center row. If the robot places them on the center goal, then two additional tetras are put on top of each of the corner goals on the side of the alliance that put the vision tetra on the center goal, if a vision tetra is place on a side goal, then a bonus tetra is placed on top of the goal in the alliance's home row that is on the same side as the capped goal.
 </p>
 <p>A tetra placed on top of a goal is worth three and is considered "stacked". At the end of the match, if all robots are behind the starting line near your alliance station, then you will receive ten points. If a row of goals is "owned," then the alliance receives ten points. A goal is considered "owned" if the owning alliance has the top stacked tetra on the goal, or if there are no stacked tetras, then the highest contained tetras.

<h3>Aim High</h3>
 <p>Robots compete in alliances of three to score the most points for their alliance. The game starts with a ten-second "autonomous" period, where robots must move without direction from the drivers. Next, the alliance that scored the most points in autonomous mode is on defense for forty seconds (meaning one of their robots can't go across the middle of the field) while the other alliance is on offense. The alliances switch roles for the next forty seconds, culminating in a final forty-second "free for all" period where robots can move anywhere on the field. Robots can score points in three ways:
 </p>
	<ol>
	 <li>Robots can throw balls into an elevated goal at the center of the wall to score three points per ball.</li>
	 <li>Robots can push or throw balls into either of two goals located against the wall at the sides of the field, earning one point per ball. </li>
	 <li>Robots can end the match on top of a ramp at the center of the wall to gain five points (for one robot), ten points (for two robots), or twenty-five points (for three or more robots). (A team can score points if an opposing robot is on the wrong ramp at the end of the game.)</li>
	</ol>

<h3>Rack N Roll</h3>
 <p>Robots compete in alliances of three to score the most points for their alliance. The game focuses on robots placing toroidal, or donut-like game pieces onto the titular "Rack"
 </p>
 <p>The WBI robot used in this year's game was Rowdy VIII.
