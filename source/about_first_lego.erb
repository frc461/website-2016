<h1>First LEGO League</h1>
<p>FIRST LEGO League is a miniature version of FIRST robotics meant for younger students. Participants build and program a robot using the Lego Mindstorms kit. The members of Team 461 act as mentors to our LEGO League teams. Every year, middle and junior high school students ages nine to 14 are given the opportunity to design, build, and program a robot using LEGO bricks, sensors, motors, and gears. This gives the team members hands-on experience in basic engineering and computer programming. </p>
<p>FIRST LEGO League International, consisting of several different tasks to be completed by each team's LEGO robot, gives a new challenge out every year. Each team has two minutes and thirty seconds to make their robot do as many tasks as possible, with each task worth a predetermined number of points. An award is given to the top-scoring team, as well as to teams who excel in other categories. </p>
<p>FIRST LEGO League is a fast-growing event. As of 2009, there were 14,600 teams participating in almost 500 FIRST-sanctioned tournaments all over the world. These competitions culminate in the FIRST LEGO League World Festival, held in conjunction with the FIRST Robotics Championship Event in Atlanta, Georgia, at the Georgia Dome. </p>
